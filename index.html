					<h3>Chinese Hot Pot</h3>
					<p>Basically, you have a pot of deliciously flavored soup and you cook things in this pot of soup. </p>
					<p>The soup boils the entire time you are eating, which can last for hours for a hot pot meal. Then you dip the food you cooked in a bowl of sauce(my favorite is sesame sauce).</p>
					<p>Every winter, I hosted hot pot parties and invite 4 or 5 friends over. We'd eat this and drink saki. Best feeling ever!</p>

					<h3>Green papaya salad</h3>
					<p>Wonder what this is made from? It is made from shredded unripe papaya! This salad is spicy, juicy, savory, with crumbled toasted peanut on top. It is simply amazing!</p>
					<p>So traditionally, this salad has <strong>a lot</strong> of chopped bird eye chili. Which I think is the best way to eat it.</p>

					<p><h3>Krorean BBQ</h3></p>
					<p>Korean BBQ, literally means "meat roast" in Korean.</p>
					<p>Typically, you would have beef, pork and chicken. Often times, these meats are marinated to extreme deliciousness. Often times, they are marinated to be <em>bulgogi</em>,which is very common in Korea.</p>
					<p>This dish is so good. I get a food baby almost every time when I eat it!</p>

					<p><h3>Tacos!</h3></p>
					<p>If you don't like tacos, I doubt we can be friends.</p>
					<p>I met tacos when I came to America. We have had the most amazing and stable relationship. I had so many $2 tacos from Mission Taco. Every taco I eat, my relationship with tacos grow stronger and deeper. </p>
					<p>Have hope. Eat tacos.</p>
